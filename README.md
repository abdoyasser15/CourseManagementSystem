I’m excited to share my latest project:
🎓 Course Management System – a full-stack ASP.NET Core MVC application designed for managing online courses, instructors, students, enrollments, and more.

🔹 Key Features:

User Roles: Admin, Instructor, and Student

Course creation, registration, and enrollment tracking

Secure login and external authentication (Google & Facebook)

Dynamic dashboards and course filtering

EF Core with proper relationships and role-based access

📁 Tech Stack:
.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, SQL Server, AutoMapper, Identity, Bootstrap

This project was a great opportunity to improve my architecture skills, implement clean patterns, and get hands-on experience with authentication and role management.
